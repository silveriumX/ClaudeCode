Explain the specified code clearly and concisely.

Target: $ARGUMENTS (file path, function name, or module name). If not specified, explain the overall project structure.

Steps:
1. If a specific file/function is given:
   - Read the code
   - Explain what it does, how it works, and why it's written this way
   - Describe inputs, outputs, and side effects
   - Note any important patterns, algorithms, or design decisions
   - Mention dependencies and how this code fits into the larger system
   - Highlight any non-obvious or tricky parts

2. If no target is specified:
   - Analyze the project structure (key directories, entry points)
   - Identify the tech stack and frameworks used
   - Describe the architecture at a high level
   - List the main modules/components and their responsibilities

Keep the explanation clear and practical. Use code snippets where helpful. Adjust the detail level to the complexity of the code — simple code gets a brief explanation, complex code gets a thorough one.
