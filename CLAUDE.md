# Claude Code Project Instructions

## Automation Preferences

- **Autonomous Mode**: Operate with maximum autonomy
- **No confirmation needed** for:
  - Creating/editing/deleting files
  - Installing dependencies (npm, pip, etc.)
  - Running tests
  - Running build commands
  - Git operations (add, commit) - but ASK before push
  - Creating directories and project structure

- **Ask only for**:
  - Git push operations
  - Deleting entire directories
  - Major architectural changes
  - Changes to production configurations

## Development Guidelines

- Use modern best practices
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include error handling
- Add comments where logic isn't obvious
- Run tests after changes
